# dynamic-desirability-test
Test repo for dynamic desirability on subnet 13


The design for this feature can be found in [miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK9-iLwo=/).

Validators must request write access to this repo in order to submit their desirabilities.

We will use this repo to test the pulling and data aggregation workflows. 

## Open Questions

How can we test the commit hash workflow? 

We can use testnet; either a new netuid or an existing one (e.g. subnet 1 @ netuid 61 or netuid 102).

THEN DELETE ME.
